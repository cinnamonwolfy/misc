# Random C Tests

## The purpose of this file

This file was created for the sole purpose of documenting any and all experiments
I do within the C programming language. The motive of documentating all of these
experiments is to help out other C programmers by cutting down the time they have
to spend on Google, StackOverflow and other places, trying to get answers.
